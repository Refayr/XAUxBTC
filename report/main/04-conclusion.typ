  This final chapter summarizes the project outcomes, comparing them with the initial objectives. It also reflects on encountered difficulties and discusses possible improvements or future developments.

  Key elements:
  - *Summarize the results* – What are the key takeaways from the project?
  - *Compare with objectives* – Did the project meet its original goals? Why or why not?
  - *Reflect on challenges* – What were the biggest difficulties, and what was learned?
  - *Discuss future work* – What are possible improvements or next steps?

This project leads us to realise that there are a high correlation between a non-negligeable amount (15) of cryptocurrencies and gold value.
Therefore, predicting future gold price regarding cryptocurrencies is not that simple and even a mix of powerfull machine learning algorithm (ARIMA + LSTM) cannot give useful insight of any change in gold exchange rate.

== Further movement
Hyper parameter testing may lead to better results at the cost of time consuming model fine tuning. Also, a biggedr dataset with more culture exogenous data may improve the predictions.
